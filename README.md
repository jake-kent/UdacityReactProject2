# Would You Rather Project

## Description
This app allows users to play the game would you rather.
- Users can select their name from a list to log in
- Once logged in, users will be able to view a homepage with two lists of questions they have answered and those they have not yet answered
- Users have the ability to answer unanswered questions, create new questions and view the leaderboard

## How To Run
 - run `npm install` followed by `npm start`

## n.b.
While created questions cannot be viewed directly by typing in their url as per the note on the Project Description on the Udacity website, users can vote on and view created questions by any user by clicking the link to that question on the homepage. I assume this is the correct/expected behavior but just wanted to call it out.
